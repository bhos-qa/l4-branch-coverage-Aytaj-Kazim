# Coverage Research Learning Outputs

## Statement Coverage
- Statement coverage aims to ensure that each line of code in a program is executed at least once during testing.
- It provides a basic level of code coverage but may not guarantee thorough testing of all code paths.
- To achieve statement coverage, test cases should be designed to exercise each line of code individually.

## Branch Coverage
- Branch coverage goes a step further than statement coverage by ensuring that all possible branches in the code are taken.
- It helps uncover logical conditions and decision points within the code.
- Achieving 100% branch coverage can be challenging, especially in complex code with numerous conditional statements.

## Predicate Coverage
- Predicate coverage, also known as condition coverage, focuses on testing the various conditions (true and false) within the code.
- It ensures that each condition is evaluated both positively and negatively.
- Predicate coverage is essential for uncovering potential bugs related to conditional logic.
